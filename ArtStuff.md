# Unhinged Rant About Art/Fic Thieves

The Internet is a weird place.

Sometimes it's fun. Sometimes it's weird. Sometimes it's full of people with not a single ounce of respect for artists/writers.

## The Debacle

Within the past year or so, it was brought to light that YouTubers were scraping fan fiction off sites like Archive of Our Own and FanFiction.net to put on their channels. The most they would do is put the fanfic through a text-to-speech bot, put it over some FPS gameplay, and monetize the absolute crud out of it.

This is what you might recognize as a content farm. Low-effort garbage spewed out at robotic rates, and some of these channels have the audacity to put a Patreon or something along those lines on their channel. Some even go so far as to claim _they're_ the writers of so-and-so fanfic!

Needless to say, the fanfic community was __livid__.

Fan fiction is a weird thing in regard to copyright law. Technically, it's using the characters and setting of a copyrighted work, but at the same time, it's not something that was created by the creator of that piece of media. By all accounts, a fan fiction belongs to the fanfic author, which means if you put it on your cruddy little content farm and profit off of it, you're violating their copyright.

Thus, this little group of fanfic authors came together to strike down as many of these content farms as possible! They have a bot that checks for stolen content and a website and everything! They're the Copy Knights. ðŸ™‚

Unfortunately, some of those channels are _relentless_. No matter how many times they've been struck down, they'll come up with another content farm and continue to steal other people's works for profit. If they get hit with a copyright strike, more often than not they'll try to manipulate the person who issued the strike into removing it with some poorly-worded sob story.

No offense, but I literally could not care less if you stole my work to pay for college. There's a more honest way to go about that than screwing over artists who just want to share their works.

## "Credit to the Artist" Means Nothing

I'm a digital artist. I like to make stuff and post it to social media for people who might like it.

Unfortunately, much like the fanfic thieves from before, you have people who'll take art from other people and repost it on sites like Pinterest with descriptions as vague as "credit to the artist".

Listen. "Credit to the artist" means nothing. You're not saying who the artist is, nor are you linking their social media or anything of the sort. "Credit to the artist" is a lazy way of trying to fend off the copyright hounds, not to mention it's the easiest way of raising the ire of whatever artist you're unfortunate enough to stumble upon.

## AI Stinks

I don't like AI.

It's a weird thing for me, personally. It's a useful tool in some areas while it's the bane of my existence in others.

What I'm saying is, AI has no place in art or writing in any sort of capacity, and if your argument is that it's a useful tool no matter what, tell that to all the electricity you're wasting on asking ChatGPT what countries have the letter "K" in them.

So, let me tell you a particularly infuriating story involving AI.

A couple years ago, a Korean artist was streaming herself making fanart for _Genshin Impact_. Specifically, of a character with electricity-based powers. She was sketching, messing with colors, so on and so forth. Then some jerkwad got onto the stream, took her sketches, and fed them to an AI art generator to complete the work before her. He proceeded to harass her on social media, insisting that _she_ stole from _him_ and that _she_ needed to credit _him_ for the work _he_ stole from _her_. Unsurprisingly, nobody bought his bull, but even then, he insisted _he_ was the wronged artist to the very end.

It's the garbage with NFTs all over again. Why is it _our_ fault for posting our works on social media when _you_ should have the common decency to _not_ steal other people's blood, sweat, and tears? Should we stop posting our work altogether to stop people from stealing it and training AI on it?

Also, AI-generated art is garbage, anyway. It's just copy-pasting elements from different works and putting them into one work without trying to make it look decent.

## Conclusion?

I have a lot of opinions about digital art and stuff, I guess.
