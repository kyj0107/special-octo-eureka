# Unhinged Copyright-Related Rant?

Copyright is a weird thing, let me tell you.

I'm no expert on copyright in general, but what I know is that it's _supposed_ to protect the rights of creators/owners to produce and distribute their creative works. It gets a bit messier when you consider the Internet and the DMCA, but that's the gist of it.

Given the current landscape, with companies being overprotective of their works and AI poisoning everything it touches (sorry, Dale, but you're going to have to try harder to convince me AI is worth anything), I... surprisingly have a lot to say about it.

## "Credit to the Artist" Doesn't Mean Anything

_So_, the world of digital art is a mess. You have people who share the works of their favorite artists and credit them properly, and then you have people who post others' art on Pinterest with "credit to the artist", which doesn't even mean anything because "the artist" in question could be anybody. Basically, you're stealing if you do that, and if you can't be bothered to do your due diligence when it comes to crediting artists, what business do you even have on the Internet?

An artist I'm friends with has dealt with this problem a LOT. See, she's a well-known artist over on our weird corner of the Internet, but because she draws for a lot of popular fandoms, people will take her art and repost it on other websites without crediting her. It's insane. From what I can tell, she hasn't run into anything like that in a while, but there's no telling who's taking her stuff and getting away with telling everyone it's actually theirs.

Really, the lesson here is: value your own work, and don't let those losers take advantage of your hard work.

OH, AND SPEAKING OF--

## FPS Gameplay With AI Voiceover of Fanfic Is Lazy

Allow me to explain to you, "The Debacle".

Within the last year or so, it was brought to light that YouTubers were stealing fanfic and making low-effort videos with AI-generated voiceovers and FPS gameplay for profit. Some were going as far as to claim that _they_ were the writers of those fics, tricking people into subscribing and giving them money for their "work".

Do you have any idea how discouraging that is? Seeing your blood, sweat, and tears used by someone who's only in the creative field for profit?

I guess now would be a good time to introduce the Copy Knights! They're a volunteer group working to stop these YouTubers from scraping fics off the Internet for their low-effort content farms, and dozens of channels have already been documented and labeled accordingly. Some are genuine podfic channels who want to bring their favorite fanfic to more potential viewers, some are just low-effort content farms who're only in it for the money.

Of course, you have channels that are _still_ throwing spaghetti at the wall to try and make it stick. They're basically that one meme from SpongeBob: "How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man?!" It's... ridiculous. Just stop already! It's clear to everyone what you're doing, and you're insane if you think you can keep taking other people's work for profit.

Ugh, and don't even get me started on the sob stories they come up with when they get copyright strikes. It's always some AI-generated garbage trying to manipulate the writers into letting them continue to steal from them. They're hilarious to read, but you really have to wonder who's this desperate to make $10 off a video of someone else's work.

## The Real Reason We're Here

A couple days ago, Nintendo announced their new mobile app: Nintendo Music. You can listen to songs from all kinds of video games, put in place an anti-spoiler filter, sort by moods and character motifs--it sounds all fine and good! Well, until you get to the part where they tell you that you need a Nintendo Switch Online membership to be able to use the app at all, _and_ NSO costs _money_.

I don't doubt for a single second that _this_ is why Nintendo has been breathing down the necks of YouTube channels who post Nintendo soundtracks as of late. Sure, their video game music is free and accessible to everybody, but the problem is that _Nintendo_ isn't the one making money off their music! Hence, countless channels, from BrawlStorms (I think that's what the channel was called? It's been so long since they were terminated) to GilvaSunner (some archives of their stuff still exist, but it's only a matter of time before those are found and taken down...), have been lost to copyright strikes.

The thing that infuriates me the most about this is that if Nintendo is going to such great lengths to make their music as exclusive and inaccessible as possible, the least they could do is be _thorough_ in their video game soundtracks. You want the music from _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_? Have the cutscene music, too! We'll even throw in the trailer music!

And what do they have on their stupid app so far?

____Diddly. Squat.____

Heck, having a _YouTube channel_ for their music would've worked much better! But with how annoying YouTube's monetization policies are, I guess it's just easier to charge people for NSO just to use an app that barely has anything.

(Unrelated, but I think one of the reasons Rooster Teeth took anything to do with _RWBY_ except the trailers off YouTube was because they weren't getting as much money as they'd liked off Youtube. Oh, and to force more people to go to their broken website and pay for a subscription to watch episodes early.)

Ugh, and this isn't even the first time Nintendo did something this stupid.

Some years ago, they tried to implement a rule where they would get a share of YouTube Let's Players' profits because in their sick, twisted mind, they thought they were "owed" that money. Let's Plays are a weird gray area in terms of copyright law, but at the end of the day, it's not _Nintendo_ that's playing their games for an audience to watch. It's not _Nintendo_ that's offering neat little tips and tricks or insightful commentary on gameplay or whatever.

Unsurprisingly, they faced _so much backlash_ that they rolled that rule back almost immediately.

## I don't have a clever conclusion

This probably reads more as an unhinged, unorganized rant about things that slightly pertain to copyright, but honestly, I couldn't come up with anything else where I could rant for long enough. So here, I guess?
