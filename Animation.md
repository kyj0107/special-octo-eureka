# The Wonderful ~~and Terrifying~~ World of Animation

I mentioned this in my Digital Video Challenge (I think. I already don't remember), but I've been dabbling in animation for the past... few months?

## The Beginning of My Weird Adventure

I, uh, watched all of _SAO Abridged_ (it's funny, but it has A LOT of adult humor, so watch at your own discretion!). The intro song to the second arc is "A Real Life" by Greek Fire, and I went and searched it on YouTube. Lo and behold, the full song was on there, so I gave it a listen. It's a good song! There were people in the comments talking about _SAO Abridged_ and... a stick figure in gold armor. Gildedguy, they called him. I got curious, looked it up, and...

_Wow._

It's called ["Gildedguy vs. Bog"](https://youtu.be/CQL-ixTcqWU)! True to those comments, a stick figure in gold armor fights a stick figure made of acid, and it uses "A Real Life" as the main song of the animation!

It's hard to explain, but there's something magical about animating a fight scene to a particular song.

Honestly, when I think of animated fight scenes, I think of _RWBY_ (well, the first three volumes). At a certain point it feels less like a fight scene and more like... choreographed dancing? I think the best example of that would be the [Yellow Trailer](https://youtu.be/QCw_aAS7vWI), if you wanna give that a watch.

It just blows you away. What else is there to say?

## 3D Animation Stinks

Like a lunatic, I refuse to touch 3D animation with a 50-foot pole.

Don't get me wrong. I understand the benefits of 3D animation! Fun fact: when they were producing _Miraculous Ladybug_, they switched from 2D animation to 3D animation so they could create a texture for Ladybug's suit that wouldn't cause motion sickness! However, 2D animation, in my opinion, is a timeless art form that shouldn't be ignored entirely.

From what I understand, a big part of why it's being phased out in favor of 3D animation has to do with money. 2D animation takes a lot of time and money to make, whereas 3D animation is usually as simple as creating some models and having them move a certain way.

Special effects are a big part of it, too! Last semester, I took a class on motion graphics, and I think I have Adobe After Effects down to a T!

That being said... Blender and After Effects made my computer choke. _A lot_.

What do you mean it takes 2 days to animate this 10-second thing in Blender? What do you mean Blender didn't save my progress with Archipack? What do you mean After Effects froze my entire computer?!

Hence, I've just been messing with ibisPaint. They introduced an animation feature... about a year ago? And since I'm not trying to animate to music right now, I'm just going nuts with what I can do with it.

## Animation Is Hard

Unfortunately, I can see why they phased out 2D animation. It's _hard_. So far, I've tried drawing things frame by frame, but it might've been helpful to have a storyboard or something drawn somewhere else. Granted, I'm no professional animator, but I'm not a professional artist either, and that hasn't exactly stopped me, has it?
