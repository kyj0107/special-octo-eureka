# The Wonderful World of Animation

I mentioned this in my Digital Video Challenge (I think. I already don't remember), but I've been dabbling in animation for the past... few months?

## The Beginning of My Weird Adventure

I, uh, watched all of _SAO Abridged_ (it's funny, but it has A LOT of adult humor, so watch at your own discretion!). The intro song to the second arc is "A Real Life" by Greek Fire, and I went and searched for it on YouTube. Lo and behold, the full song was on there, so I gave it a listen. It's a good song! There were people in the comments talking about _SAO Abridged_ and... a stick figure in gold armor. Gildedguy, they called him. I got curious, looked it up, and...

_Wow._

It's called ["Gildedguy vs. Bog"](https://youtu.be/CQL-ixTcqWU)!
