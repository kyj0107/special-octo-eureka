# IT 1600 Markdown Pages on GitHub Challenge

Hello! I present to you my Markdown pages!

I'll probably create two or three Markdown pages and write whatever I can think of. I know this is meant to demonstrate my skills in Markdown, but that's always the trouble with these kinds of assignments--I have lots of creative freedom, but what do I even put down?

Anyhoo...
